Remove printing part to make algorithm much more efficient. <br>
Learned about this from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs. <br>
Explanation of that video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE. <br>
Physics can be modified and used in more useful project. <br>

Algorithm for physics is implemented based on this wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#Equations <br>
and is standard model for computing 2d elastic collisions. <br>

Project written in Polish as its a School project
